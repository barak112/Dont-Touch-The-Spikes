# Dont Touch The Spikes - Assembly project

This is my 10th grade assembly project i have made throught the year.
All commented and working, it is my own assembly version of the popular game "Don't Touch The Spikes".
If you have any questions about the code feel free to ask.

To run the project, open DosBox, mount to the correct location and write the command:
  call run spikes
